While the majority of valuable parsing information is automatically gathered during the ingestion of logs into the New Relic platform, building additional queries can be a very manual and labor-intensive exercise. The new click-to-parse productivity hack allows you to easily select any string from your log file, then parse out repeatable values for alpha-numeric input, reducing manual entry and time to create queries. With a single click you can parse any variables from string attributes without writing any additional script.
